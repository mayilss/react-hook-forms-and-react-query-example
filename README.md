# React Hook Forms and React Query Example

This repository contains an example project showcasing the integration of React Hook Forms and React Query. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to effectively use React Hook Forms for form management and React Query for data fetching and caching within a React application. It serves as a simple todo app to illustrate how to handle CRUD operations using React Hook Forms and React Query. By combining these two libraries, developers can create forms that efficiently handle user input validation, submission, and asynchronous data fetching without the need for additional state management libraries.
